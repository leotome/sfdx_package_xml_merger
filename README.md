# Salesforce package.xml merger

This tool was created to allow you to merge different "package.xml" files into one. It can be invoked using arguments, or via interactive CLI.

If you use it through arguments, the current version only supports 3 fixed arguments, and you need to provide them in the specific order.

program.java <path_for_files_to_merge> <sfdx_version> <file_output_name>
